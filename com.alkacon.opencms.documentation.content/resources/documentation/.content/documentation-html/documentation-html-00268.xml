      <content><![CDATA[<p>An element group is a content element similar to Inheritance group, which allow the user to drop other elements in it. The user can edit, delete or replace the elements inside the group as well as changing their order. All changes on the element group affect all container pages to which the element group is dropped. So the element group allows maintaining the referenced elements in one place to take effect on many pages.</p>]]></content>
