      <content><![CDATA[<p>Usually when placing a content element on a container page, the reference to this element is stored within the container page XML-content. With the elements in detail containers, this would not work, as there is only one detail page content for many news items.</p>
<p>When using the detail containers feature OpenCms will automatically create and manage a new container page XML-content for each news item. Within this content the element references will be stored. In case of the news <code>/.content/news/news_0001.html</code> this would be <code>/.content/news/.detailContainers/news_0001.html</code>. So by convention the file is placed in a subfolder to the news item location called <code>.detailContainers</code> and it is named like the news itself. During the rendering process the same convention is used to look up detail container elements. So deleting a <code>.detailContainers</code>-folder will remove all related elements to the present news.</p>]]></content>
