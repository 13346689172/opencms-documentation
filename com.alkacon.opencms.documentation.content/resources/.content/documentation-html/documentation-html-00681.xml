      <content><![CDATA[<p>OpenCms ships with a default configuration for indexed fields that is optimized w.r.t. the structure of OpenCms resources. So, for example, properties are already indexed. What is impossible to capture by a default configuration are the following decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which schema elements of a structured content should be mapped to special index fields (of special type)?</li>
<li>Should an XML content be findable as the content itself, or only the container-page the content is located on?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to both questions is mainly specific to your use-case. Thus you have to choose the settings by yourself. As use cases you may regard:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have detail pages for contents, it is usually intended to find the content as its own. Otherwise this may be not the case.</li>
<li>If you want to have facets, you may map schema elements to special fields that you use for faceting.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default</p>
<ul>
<li>The content of all schema elements of one language version will be stored in one language-specific text field called <code>content_{locale}</code>, e.g., <code>content_en</code>.</li>
<li>The content is index such, that it can be found stand-alone.</li>
</ul>
