      <content><![CDATA[<p>Permissions can either be assigned to single users, to groups and also to roles. What is the best choice, depends on your special situation. Possibly, the most appealing way is to set permissions dependent on roles. For example, the type function (Dynamic functions) has set the permissions such that template developers can add new such such functions or edit existing ones, while normal workplace users can only view such functions, i.e. add or remove them from pages.</p>
<p>Besides setting permissions for specific roles, groups or users, you can set default permissions for a resource type. They overwrite the system defaults, but are overwritten by all settings that are set for a role, group or user.</p>]]></content>
