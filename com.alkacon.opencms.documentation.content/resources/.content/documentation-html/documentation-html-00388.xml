      <content><![CDATA[<p><em>A site navigation must adjust itself if the site structure changes.</em> In OpenCms you can add or remove pages from your website dynamically. These changes should automatically mirror in the site navigation. If a page is removed, it should not appear anymore. If a page is added, it should be reachable via the navigation. In OpenCms you can write such dynamic navigations using the <code>&lt;cms:navigation&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p><em>One navigation must be usable at several pages.</em> Typically, you write one navigation (of one type) and display it on various pages of your website. The entries in the navigation fit to the very page, the navigation is placed.</p>
<p><em>There are differents types of navigations.</em> Usually a webpage provides various different navigations. There is some top navigation, bringing you to the main pages of your website, there may be a side navigation that displays where the current page is placed in the navigation tree and that is used to navigate relative to that page. And last, there are breadcrumbs that tell you the way from the home page of your site to the current page. OpenCms provides support for all three of these navigations.</p>]]></content>
