      <content><![CDATA[<p>When you use the "Publish" option in the editors toolbar, your current changes are saved and the publish dialog appears in "Direct publish" mode. The resources shown are all (changed) resources that form the bundle, i.e., all property bundle files and the bundle descriptor.</p>
<p>Unlike other editors, the bundle editor does not close when the publish action is triggered. Thus, you can directly go on and edit - with one tiny exception:</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">You can only proceed to edit the bundle when the publishing finished for the resources you want to edit. Otherwise they are locked with a publish lock. So you might have to wait a moment until you can proceed to edit the bundle.</div>]]></content>
