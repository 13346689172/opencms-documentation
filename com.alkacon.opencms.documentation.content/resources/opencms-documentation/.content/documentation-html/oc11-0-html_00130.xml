      <content><![CDATA[<p>When a publish event occurs, the flex cache entries are flushed depending on the buckets they belong to. In particular, an entry is deleted if:</p>
<ul>
<li>a resource is published that is in one of the configured root paths of a bucket assigned to the entry.</li>
<li>a resource under one of the VFS root paths configured as <code>clearAll</code> is published.</li>
<li>no bucket is assigned to the entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our example configuration this means in particular, that publishing changes in site "baz" will not flush the buckets for sites "bar" and "foo".</p>]]></content>
