      <content><![CDATA[<p>A module is basically the collection of resources from the VFS attached with some configuration. Typically, resources that are required to make up some functionality are grouped as a module. The group can either be very fine-granular, e.g., contain only a new resource type and provide schema, formatter, maybe some Java library and configuration of it, or, it can be very coarse, containing all the resources you need to build up a website, i.e., template JSP, resource types (with schemas and formatters), images, JavaScript, CSS, jars, classes, .... What's the correct choice for you depends on your use case and is <a href="%(link0)">discussed later on</a>.</p>
<p>Grouping resources into modules has several advantages, because the modules are more than the simple collections of resources. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>import and export modules</li>
<li>define dependencies between modules</li>
<li>use version numbers</li>
<li>add module parameters to adjust a module's behavior for varying systems, e.g., configure data-base connections</li>
<li>group related modules</li>
<li>configure actions triggered when a module is imported, updated or removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid naming conflicts, modules are named like Java packages, e.g., <code>com.mydomain.mymodule</code>. This name is also called the module's package name.<span class="footnote">Your module may additionally also have a more human readable name, as well as a description etc.</span></p>]]></content>
