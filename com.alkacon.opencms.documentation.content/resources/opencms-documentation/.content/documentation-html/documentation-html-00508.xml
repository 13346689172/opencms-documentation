<li><strong>Todos</strong>: Here you see all the TODOs that are open in the documentation</li>
<li><strong>Screenshot review</strong>: Here you can check if all screenshots are up-to-date for the documentation's version, replace screenshots or simply mark them as up-to-date</li>
<li><strong>Content sanitizers</strong>: They allow to
<ul>
<li>touch each content, sanitize it and store it again. (This is useful to update topic and section title properties, or if the structure of a content should have changed.)</li>
<li>delete unused contents, as for example may remain when you delete a section, but not the contents that were placed in the section.</li>
</ul>
