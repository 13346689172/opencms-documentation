      <content><![CDATA[<p>The most interesting thing about a dynamic function is the <em>function provider</em>. It is used to render the dynamic function. So, it's comparable to a formatter for the other content types. Loosely spoken, each dynamic function content holds its own formatter or even formatters. Via the <em>formatter options</em> you can choose in which containers the dynamic function can be placed and via <em>additional format</em>, alternative function providers can be specified. The element settings can be read by the function provider to alter it's behavior. Just like they are read in formatters for other content types.</p>
<p>Besides element settings, also parameters can be defined in a dynamic function. These <em>parameters</em> are passed as request parameters to the function provider each time it is called. You can also pass parameters dynamically as for each other page, e.g., when rendering a form's result page. These parameters are not defined in the dynamic function.</p>
<p><em>Title</em> and <em>description</em> should be chosen in a meaningful way. They are displayed in the add wizard of the page editor to identify the function.</p>]]></content>
