      <content><![CDATA[<p>Note that the settings starting at "Teaser text length" are already settings from display formatters, but they are shown like the above "normal" list settings. Additionally to the settings appearing as native list settings, there are settings in the extra section "Compact event teaser". These are clearly separated and it is visible to the editor that they apply to event teasers only. The different ways to integrate display formatter settings to the list settings become relevant mostly if lists collect elements of more than one type and the various display formatter might have settings that are shared between all of them - as for example configuration of the teaser length.</p>]]></content>
