      <content><![CDATA[<p>Our website already exists in three different locale variants. To let the user visiting the site switch from one locale to another, a language switcher is necessary. It should work as follows: For each page, you should be able to switch to all available translations. If no translation is available, you can either not switch or go to the home page in the target locale. Of course, these are suggestions and you can implement a different logic if you like.</p>
<p>The Apollo-Template already contains a locale switcher. And you may have noticed, that it already appeared above the main navigation. It is rendered by a "Link Sequence" that resides in the "Header" model group used on all pages.</p>]]></content>
