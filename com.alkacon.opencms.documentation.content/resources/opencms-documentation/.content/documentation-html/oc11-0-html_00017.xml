      <content><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, it is desired to have two slightly different element settings. But for reasons of consistency they shall have the same <code>Setting name</code>in the formatter configuration, with which you call them in your JSP. Applied to the example above, you can limit the number of date formats to select, and still call the shortened list with the same EL annotation. This is enabled by the field <code>Include name</code> in the formatter configuration.</p>
