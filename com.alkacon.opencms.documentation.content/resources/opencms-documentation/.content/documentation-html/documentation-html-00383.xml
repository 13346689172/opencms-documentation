      <content><![CDATA[<p><em>The documentation is mainly topic based.</em> Each page can be your first page when reading it. And dependent on your pre-knowledge and your current question, each page can be the perfect place to start. If you get lost, links may bring you quickly to the missing information. Some pages just provide overviews on topics to help you getting the "big picture".</p>
<p><em>The documentation provides some interactive demos.</em> Some features are best explained by seeing them in action and playing with them. The topics placed in the section "Demo" provide such demos. To use them you must read the documentation in your local OpenCms installation. It is shipped with the standard OpenCms installation.</p>]]></content>
