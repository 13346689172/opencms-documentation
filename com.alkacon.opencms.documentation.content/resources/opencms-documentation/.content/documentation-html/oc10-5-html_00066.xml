      <content><![CDATA[<p>Note that in the above figure, one of the edit points is darker than the others. It's actually not one edit point. It are two overlapping edit points. The one for the segment and the one for the upper row. To get access to both of them you can iterate the different nesting levels of the containers via the short cut <code>CTRL + SHIFT + e</code>.</p>
