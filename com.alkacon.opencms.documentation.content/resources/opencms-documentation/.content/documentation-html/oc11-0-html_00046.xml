      <content><![CDATA[<p>In OpenCms contents are rendered by formatters when dropped on a page. If you like to have different formats of a content, you can write and configure different formatters for the same type of content. But, if you want the editor to adjust the behavior of a single formatter, you can use element settings. This is useful for providing, for example, various facets of nearly the same format.</p>
<p>Assume, you have some content type having a title. Now a setting could enable the editor to choose the level in which the headline is shown (h1, h2, h3 ...) - or if it should be shown at all.</p>
<p>The editor can change the element setting directly at the content in the page editor. The chosen value can be evaluated in the content's formatter via special JSP API.</p>]]></content>
