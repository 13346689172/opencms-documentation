      <content><![CDATA[<p>To clarify how permissions work, an example is of great help. Assume, we have a group "A" and a group "B", and a folder</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/main-folder/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>with</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/main-folder/sub-folder/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>as subfolder. Now we want all members of group A and B to have read access to <code>/main-folder/</code>, but only members of group A to have access to <code>/main-folder/sub-folder/</code>.</p>
<p>We set read access explicitely to "Allowed" for groups A and B on <code>/main-folder/</code>. Hence, as expected user that are at least in one of the groups A or B have read access to the main folder, and, via inheritance, also to <code>/main-folder/sub-folder/</code>.</p>
<p>Now we want to limit read access to the subfolder to members of group A, i.e., users only in group B and not in group A should not get access, but users that are members in both groups should.</p>
<p>The first thought is to deny read access for <code>/main-folder/sub-folder/</code> for members of group B. But that will result in a wrong permission set: Users that are member of both groups will not be able to read resources in folder <code>/main-folder/sub-folder/</code>, as shown in the graphic below:</p>]]></content>
