      <content><![CDATA[<p>Below is a figure of folders in the <em>VFS</em> which each embody the top level of a language specific sub-site. On the other hand these folders belong to the sub-site called <em>site</em> and are to deliver content in three different languages. On each of these folders the <em>locale</em> property should be set so that all child folders, pages and resources inherit the locale of the parent folder unless they define them individually. The <em>locale</em> property will be used by OpenCms to assign specific XML-Contents and can be accessed in a JSP among other.</p>]]></content>
