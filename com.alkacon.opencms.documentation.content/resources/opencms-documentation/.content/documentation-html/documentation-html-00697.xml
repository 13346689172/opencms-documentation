      <content><![CDATA[<p>In general, there is no restriction on what resources belong to a module and where in the VFS these resources are located. But there is a best practice that you should apply to avoid confusion or unintended side-effects.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">It is strongly recommended to stick to the best practice explained below.</div>
<p>Basically, a module's resources are located in a special module folder. It is named after the modules package name and located under <code>/system/modules/</code> in the root site of the VFS. For example, the module <code>com.mydomain.mymodule</code> will have the module folder <code>/system/modules/com.mydomain.mymodule/</code> in the VFS.</p>
<p>Dependent on the actual resources located in the module, the following subfolders are added to the module folder.</p>]]></content>
