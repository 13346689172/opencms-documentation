      <content><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it is necessary to make the OpenCms workplace only available for specific IPs. This can be achieved by setting up a firewall application for the web server that filters the access to the OpenCms workplace.</p>
<p>Another option is to add additional rewrite rules to the virtual host configuration of the OpenCms workplace in your webserver configuration.</p>
<p>The following example shows an Apache webserver configuration that blocks all IP addresses that do not start with <code>127.0.</code>. It can be modified to allow other IPs to access the OpenCms workplace server. For more details, refer to the Apache <code>mod_rewrite</code> module documentation.</p>]]></content>
