        <content><![CDATA[<p>Similarly to the "Elements in page" mode, all container pages the provided content is placed on are collected. Now you can rename nested containers made up by the elements. This can be interesting if your formatter for the element has changed and now the nested container has a different name. Unless you rename the container in all exsisting container pages, the contents in that containers will not display anymore.</p>]]></content>
