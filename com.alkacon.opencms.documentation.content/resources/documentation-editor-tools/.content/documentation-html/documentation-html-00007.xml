      <content><![CDATA[<p>Topics are meant as "being one with a page". They have no headline etc., because this comes from the page. The topic's title property is automatically set to the page's title. Topics are automatically placed on each new page and you do not get an option to add new topics. Since <strong>each page of the documentation should have exactly one topic content</strong>.</p>
<p>T<strong>opic information are used at several places</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teasers are used in topic rows</li>
<li>Todos are collected from the editor tools</li>
<li>Other meta information, such as version info will probably be used later on for automatic generation of overview pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics also provide <strong>extra fields for placing links to related topics/resources</strong>. One maxim of topic based writing is "link richly". Thus links to related sources should be given right at the topic. Providing them in extra content fields guarantees a special format for these important links.</p>]]></content>
